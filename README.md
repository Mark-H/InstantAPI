InstantAPI
==========

A MODX plugin that instantly turns any MODX resource into JSON.


Installation
1. Save the plugin code, and check the "OnPageNotFound" event.


Usage
1. Visit any page on your site, and add ".json" to the end of the URL. The page will return a JSON-formatted string containing all of the page's data.


Roadmap/Wishlist
1. Fix problem with tags in the content area not being parsed before JSONification (help me, Hamstra-wan Kenobi, you're my only hope)
2. Add support for template variable content
